    <h1>Dear Jassi 🌸</h1>

    <p>
      Six months from now, you’ll look back and realize  
      how brave you were to take this step.
    </p>

    <p>
      There will exciting days, tiring days, and days of doubt —  
      but remember, you are capable of more than you know.
    </p>

    <p>
      I believe in you endlessly.  
      Go learn, grow, fall, rise, and shine.
    </p>

    <p class="signature">— With love, Saniya 💙</p>
